# Boston, In Fifteen Minutes

*An analysis of accessibility in Boston.*

***

## Background

The inspiration for this comes from a proposal by Anne Hidalgo, the incumbent Mayor of Paris, France. 

The proposal, called *Ville du Quart d’Heure*, or the *Fifteen-Minute City*, here reported on in great detail by 
[CityLab](https://www.citylab.com/environment/2020/02/paris-election-anne-hidalgo-city-planning-walks-stores-parks/606325/), is an urban design plan
with the intent of designing a city in which all of the basic needs of life for its residents can be satisfied within a fifteen-minute radius, by foot or by bicycle.
Such a design not only promotes sustainability in the era of climate change, but also enhances the well-being of its residents.

Paris, as it turns out, is not the only city that has presented such a sweeping urban design plan. As *CityLab* reports, Barcelona already has 
pedestrian-centric [Superblocks](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2018/08/inside-a-pedestrian-first-superblock/566864/). London is promoting it's 
[Every One Every Day](https://www.weareeveryone.org/) urban design plan. And in America, [Portland, Oregon](https://www.portlandonline.com/portlandplan/index.cfm?c=52256&a=288098)
is promoting a plan of 20-minute neighborhoods for 90% of it's residents.

But what would such a plan look like for Boston? [The Boston Planning & Development Agency](http://www.bostonplans.org/) has not laid out any specific 15- or 20-minute city plan, 
although, in the [Imagine Boston 2020](https://www.boston.gov/news/mayor-walsh-announces-planning-initiatives-downtown-east-boston-mattapan-newmarket-allston) planning initiative,
there are specific references to improving the mixed-use downtown and expanding job growth in the downtown area. To specifically look at how different areas of Boston fit into a fifteen-minute 
city design, let's first define the specific parameters of a fulfilling daily life for a citizen of Boston.

As quoted in the [CityLab Article](https://www.citylab.com/environment/2020/02/paris-election-anne-hidalgo-city-planning-walks-stores-parks/606325/)--Carlos Moreno, a professor at Paris-Sorbonne University, 
defines the basic needs as such: “There are six things that make an urbanite happy” he told Liberation. “Dwelling in dignity, working in proper conditions, [being able to gain] provisions, well-being, education and leisure."

**We can define these into several categories, and expected data points, for each:**

- **Work**
    - Average commute times to workplace.
    - Most common commute type for residents (foot, bicycle, car, bus, train)
- **Provisions**
    - Grocery stores 
    - Pharmacies
- **Education**
    - Public schools and charter schools
    - Private schools, if applicable
    - Higher education -- universities and trade schools, when applicable
- **Well-Being**
    - Hospitals
    - Urgent care centers
    - Primary care physicians
- **Leisure**
    - Public parks
    - Bars and restaurants
    - Theatres, cinemas, live entertainment, misc.

## The Fabric of Boston

Our basic unit of analysis for the city will be census tracts, one unit of magnitude below neighborhoods. Shown below is each census tract
outlined, color-coded by neighborhood name. Each census tract has some basic information available, sourced from 2010 Census Data 
[compilated by the Boston Area Research Initiative (BARI)](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/SQ6BT4).

## Commute Times and Workplace Access

The first category we'll look at is probably the most critical factor in social well-being in a neighborhood -- commute times. 
[Studies have shown](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/upshot/stuck-and-stressed-the-health-costs-of-traffic.html) that commute times are often directly
correlated with an individual's mental health -- higher commute times, especially when traveling in traffic by vehicle, correlate with higher emotional stress levels.

The simplest way to get a clear picture of the commute of the average individual in an area of the city is by using self-reported census data. Here, we're using commute 
time data again from [BARI](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/SQ6BT4). 

*Data Analysis Background*

The census data is offered to us per census tract as a proportion, broken down into five categories of commute time: 
*less than 10 minutes*, *10-30 minutes*, *30-60 minutes*, *60-90 minutes*, *more than 90 minutes*. Using 
[midpoint coding](https://www.displayr.com/how-to-calculate-an-average-value-from-categorical-data/), we find the midpoint of each of these categories (treating the midpoint of > 90 min as 105 min)
-- so, respectively, 5, 20, 45, 75, and 105 minutes for each category. We then sum `category_proportion * total_population * midpoint` for each category, and divide by the total total_population
to find the average time.

Commute times are currently displayed on a sliding color scale -- green is <= 10 minutes, red is >= 75 minutes, and everything in between is an average color value.

However, commute time isn't the only metric we should measure -- also important is commute type, data that BARI also offers us. Rather than use a red-yellow-green scale for this, we'll
mark each commute type with it's own color.

So how does this fit into the "15-minute city" model? From a glance, it seems like...not well, something that is somewhat predictable if you've ever experience Boston during rush hour. 
What's especially interesting to note is that even the "downtown" neighborhoods that one might expect to have short commute times (for example, Back Bay) still report commutes of 25-30 minutes?
A good commute time, by most people's standards, but almost double the "15-minute" metric we're looking at. Let's look at the best-performing neighborhoods more specifically.
