# Boston, In Fifteen Minutes

*An analysis of accessibility in Boston.*

***

## Background

The inspiration for this comes from a proposal by Anne Hidalgo, the incumbent Mayor of Paris, France. 

The proposal, called *Ville du Quart d’Heure*, or the *Fifteen-Minute City*, here reported on in great detail by 
[CityLab](https://www.citylab.com/environment/2020/02/paris-election-anne-hidalgo-city-planning-walks-stores-parks/606325/), is an urban design plan
with the intent of designing a city in which all of the basic needs of life for its residents can be satisfied within a fifteen-minute radius, by foot or by bicycle.
Such a design not only promotes sustainability in the era of climate change, but also enhances the well-being of its residents.

Paris, as it turns out, is not the only city that has presented such a sweeping urban design plan. As *CityLab* reports, Barcelona already has 
pedestrian-centric [Superblocks](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2018/08/inside-a-pedestrian-first-superblock/566864/). London is promoting it's 
[Every One Every Day](https://www.weareeveryone.org/) urban design plan. And in America, [Portland, Oregon](https://www.portlandonline.com/portlandplan/index.cfm?c=52256&a=288098)
is promoting a plan of 20-minute neighborhoods for 90% of it's residents.

But what would such a plan look like for Boston? [The Boston Planning & Development Agency](http://www.bostonplans.org/) has not laid out any specific 15- or 20-minute city plan, 
although, in the [Imagine Boston 2020](https://www.boston.gov/news/mayor-walsh-announces-planning-initiatives-downtown-east-boston-mattapan-newmarket-allston) planning initiative,
there are specific references to improving the mixed-use downtown and expanding job growth in the downtown area. To specifically look at how different areas of Boston fit into a fifteen-minute 
city design, let's first define the specific parameters of a fulfilling daily life for a citizen of Boston.

As quoted in the [CityLab Article](https://www.citylab.com/environment/2020/02/paris-election-anne-hidalgo-city-planning-walks-stores-parks/606325/)--Carlos Moreno, a professor at Paris-Sorbonne University, 
defines the basic needs as such: “There are six things that make an urbanite happy” he told Liberation. “Dwelling in dignity, working in proper conditions, [being able to gain] provisions, well-being, education and leisure."

**We can define these into several categories, and expected data points, for each:**

- **Work**
    - Average commute times to workplace.
    - Most common commute type for residents (foot, bicycle, car, bus, train)
- **Provisions**
    - Grocery stores 
    - Pharmacies
- **Education**
    - Public schools and charter schools
    - Private schools, if applicable
    - Higher education -- universities and trade schools, when applicable
- **Well-Being**
    - Hospitals
    - Urgent care centers
    - Primary care physicians
- **Leisure**
    - Public parks
    - Bars and restaurants
    - Theatres, cinemas, live entertainment, misc.

## The Fabric of Boston

Our basic unit of analysis for the city will be census tracts, one unit of magnitude below neighborhoods. Shown below is each census tract
outlined, color-coded by neighborhood name. Each census tract has some basic information available, sourced from 2010 Census Data 
[compilated by the Boston Area Research Initiative (BARI)](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/SQ6BT4).
